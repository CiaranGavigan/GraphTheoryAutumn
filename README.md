# Graph Theory 

this is my repeat submission for the Graph Theory module. I first had to create two Jupyter Notebooks, before researching and discussing the Heap Sort Algorithm and The Graph Isomorphism Problem.


## Technologies 

* Jupyter NoteBook
* Python (Anaconda) 

## Installation
* Install Anaconda Python - https://www.anaconda.com/
* Jupyter Notebook should already be installed with Anaconda 

#### Versions used if you want to use in Linux:
* jupyter core : 4.6.3
* jupyter-notebook : 6.0.3
* Python : 3.10.4

## Features

### Heap Sort Notebook:

* Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.
* Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.
* Python function implementing Heap Sort.
* Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

### Graph Isomorphism Notebook:

* Definition of graph isomorphism.
* Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
* Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.
* Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.


## To Use

* Start by cloning the repository into a folder.

``git clone https://github.com/CiaranGavigan/GraphTheoryAutumn``

* cd into the correct folder.

``cd graphTheoryAutumn``

* Run the command jupyter notebook to launch jupyter which will then open a browser window with your notebook.

``jupyter notebook``

* Then you can read and edit the notebooks yourself.
